    r"""Generate a simulated response matrix for adversarial workers.

    The function selects a set of tasks that are considered to be targeted by
    adversaries. Adversaries provide a wrong label to targeted points. Each
    adversary also provide labels for `p_camo` fraction of the remaining points
    as a way to camouflage themselves. Labeling behaviour of adversaries are
    follows:

    For targeted tasks:

    - For a targeted task $n$ that is in class $k$, an adversary provide the
    the label $\widehat{y}_{mn} = k' \neq k$ with probability `target_obs` and
    $\widehat{y}_{mn} = 0$, otherwise. $k'$ is the same for all targeted $n$'s
    in class k. This can be considered as adversaries trying to flip label of $n$
    from $k$ to $k'$.

    For camouflage:

    - For a non-targeted task $n$, each adversary independently provide a label
    with probability `camo_obs`, i.e., $\widehat{y}_{mn} = k \in {\cal C}$
    with probability `camo_obs` and $\widehat{y}_{mn} = 0$, otherwise. $\cal C$
    is the set of class ids. $k$ is sampled using Dawid-Skene model whose confusion
    matrix is drawn using
    [`gen_confusion_mat`][aad.simulations.gen_confusion_mat.gen_confusion_mat]
    function with reliability set to `camo_reliability`.

    ??? Example
        The following code first generates random ground truth labels for 1000
        tasks where each task belongs to one of 3 classes. Responses for 20
        adversaries are then generated.

        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import aad

        # Generate random class labels
        rng = np.random.default_rng()
        gt_labels = rng.integers(1, 4, 1000)

        aad.simulations.gen_adversaries(gt_labels, 20, target_frac=0.1, camo_obs=0.1)
        ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    gt_labels
        Ground truth labels of tasks
    n_adversaries
        Number of adversaries to produce responses for
    target_frac
        Fraction of tasks that is selected as targeted tasks
    camo_obs
        Probability of an adversary providing a label for a non-targeted task for
        camouflage.
    target_obs
        Probability of an adversary providing a label for a targeted point
    camo_reliability
        Reliability of adversaries when they are labeling non-targeted points,
        see [`gen_confusion_mat`][aad.simulations.gen_confusion_mat.gen_confusion_mat]
        for the definition of reliability.
    rng
        Random number generator

    Returns
    -------
    response_mat : npt.NDArray
        $(M, N)$ dimensional generated response matrix where $M$ is the number
        of adversaries and $N$ is the number of tasks.
    targeted_tasks : npt.NDArray
        $(N, )$ dimensional binary array where `targeted_tasks[i] = 1` if $i$th
        task is targeted, 0 otherwise.
